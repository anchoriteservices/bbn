    # This rule sends traffic to the built-in hello-world HTTP server. This can help debug connectivity
    # issues. If hello.example.com resolves and tunnel.example.com does not, then the problem is
    # in the connection from cloudflared to your local service, not from the internet to cloudflared.

  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
